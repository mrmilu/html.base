# Run production build

First generate a production build:

```shell
just build
```

Then execute the `vite preview` server:

```shell
just preview
```

This command uses under the hood the `vite preview` command. For more information refer to [Deploying a Static Site](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#deploying-a-static-site) documentation where `vite preview` is explained.
